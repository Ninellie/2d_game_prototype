# 2d_game_prototype
This is my 2D game prototype

The most important code requirements I strive for when writing:
- No repeating code
- Separation of entities into different classes
- Speaking names of classes, methotds and variables
- I try to stick to Microsoft dotnet [C# Coding Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
